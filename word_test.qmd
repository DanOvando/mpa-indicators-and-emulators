Hello world 

We do not report uncertainty of estimates, as our primary objective is
to evaluate relative performance across indicators rather than to make
statistical inferences. Given that this is a simulation-based analysis
with arbitrarily defined sample sizes, conventional statistical
significance testing is not meaningful [@white2014], so we do not
evaluate indicators against statistical significance thresholds (e.g., p
\< 0.05). Similarly, we do not account for statistical complexities such
as spatio-temporal clustering [@thorson2024a] or zero-inflation
[@zuur2009]. Applied use of empirical indicators would need to be
tailored to the local context, following best practices in modeling and
causal inference based on observational data from social-ecological
systems.

: General structure of tested indicators of MPA effects. Bolded $\beta$
parameter in **Equation** column indicates parameter interpreted as the
effect of the MPA. *B* refers to biomass, *E* refers to effort, *ML*
refers to mean length. *INSIDE* refers to patches *p* located inside MPA
borders (whether before or after MPA implementation), *OUTSIDE* to
patches outside. *AFTER* refers to time periods *t* after MPA
implementation, *BEFORE* is before MPA implementation. *NEAR* are
patches *p* outside but near the border of an MPA (whether before or
after MPA implementation), FAR is outside and farther from the border of
an MPA. {#tbl-indicators}
