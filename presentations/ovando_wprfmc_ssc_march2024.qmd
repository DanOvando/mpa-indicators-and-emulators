## Where and How Much Should We Protect?

- The key questions are **"how much?"**, **"where?"**, and **"for what?"**

- We often depend on **simulations** to answer these questions

- Lack of consistent / transparent assumptions can produce inconsistent outcomes

# 1. Introduction to the `marlin` model

## The [`marlin`](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/) Model

![[https://danovando.github.io/marlin/](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/)](imgs/marlin.png)



## Core Features

-   Full age structure of multiple fish(y) critters (automated life
    history with
    [FishLife](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishLife))
-   Multiple fleets and *mÃ©tiers* enabling **technical interactions**
  - Distributional impacts of policies on fish and people
-   2-D spatial structure with scale-free and estimable movement
-   Fast!
  - R in the front, C++ in the back
- Recursive (you can pass it to itself) for customized applications (e.g. MSE)

## Fish Model {.smaller}

::: columns

## Movement Model

Movement simulated using a *continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)^[[Thorson et al. 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12592)]*

- Movement governed by *diffusion* and *taxis* matrices
  
  - Can be separate for larvae vs. adults
  
  - See later releases for age-specific and *advection* (aka oceanography!)

  - Can be empirically estimated
  
  - Can dodge barriers (e.g. land)
  

## Movement Model {.smaller}

*Instantaneous* movement matrix is a function of diffusion rate *D*, habitat matrix *H*, and the spatial ($\Delta_d$) and temporal ($\Delta_t$) resolution

$$ 
M_{p1,p2,t,s,a} = \begin{cases}
      = \frac{\Delta_{t}}{\Delta_{d}^2}De^{\frac{\Delta_t(H(p2,t,s,a) - H(p1,t,s,a))}{\Delta_d}} & \text{if p2 and p1 are adjacent}\\
     = -\sum_{p' \neq p1} M_{p1,p2,t,s,a} & \text{if p1 = p2}\\
     = 0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-diffusion}


## Movement Model {.smaller}

This is the important part

$$ 
\frac{\Delta_{t}}{\Delta_{d}^2}De^{\frac{\Delta_t(H(p2,t,s,a) - H(p1,t,s,a))}{\Delta_d}} 
$$ {#eq-diffusion2}

## Movement Model

Numbers at age by patch then distributed each time step via matrix exponential

$$
\pmb{n}_{t+1,s,a} = \pmb{n}_{t,s,a}e^{\pmb{M}_{t,s,a}}
$$ {#eq-movement}


Scale-free parameterization means parameters can be preserved and compared across models with different spatio-temporal resolution

## Movement

![](imgs/ctmc.gif)

## Fleet Model

- *N* fleets defined by *M* *metiers*

- Fleets have
  - Cost per unit effort
  - Travel costs from ports

- *metier* defined by
  - Species
  - Price
  - Selectivity at age
  - Catchability in space
  
## Fleet Model {.smaller}
  
Catch per species calculated by Baranov equation 

$$
Y_{t,p,s,a} = \frac{u_{t,p,s,a}}{z_{t,p,s,a}} \times b_{t,p,s,a} \times (1 - e^{-z_{t,p,s,a}})
$$ {#eq-yield}

And then revenues divided to each fleet proportionally

## Fleet Model {.smaller}

$$
 R_{t,p,f} = \sum_s^{N_s} \sum_a^{N_a} \Pi_{s,f}\frac{\alpha_{a,s,f}q_{s,f}E_{t,p,f}}{u_{t,p,s,a}} \times Y_{t,p,s,a}
$$ {#eq-revenue}

Fishers then allocate effort in space based on total profits in space in last time step (conditional on management...)^[Allows for economic MPAs!]

## Fleet Model

Conditional on management management fleet can either be *constant effort*^[with or without MPA attrition] or *open access*

When *open access*, fishing effort expands and contracts in response to total profits


$$
E_{t+1,f} = E_{t,f} \times e^{\theta_f log(R_{t,f} / C_{t,f})} 
$$ {#eq-oa}


## Manager Model

Managers can set arbitrary combinations of

- Size / slot limits

- Fishing seasons by species

- Effort limits by species

- Catch quotas by species

- MPAs

- "Bycatch" penalties


# 2. Case Studies Applications


## Coral Reef Case Study

![[Ovando *et al.* 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12804)](imgs/fig_1.png)

::: {.notes}

Fleet One primarily targets the grouper and near-shore snapper populations, but will land
any incidentally captured sharks. Fleet One has a logistic selectivity
pattern for all species, as they retain any fish caught for consumption
or sale. both grouper and shallow-reef snapper due to demand for "plate
sized" fish , and logistic selectivity for sharks, as any shark caught
is retained. Fleet One is totally dependent on fishing for their
livelihood, meaning the local community takes advantage of every
possible opportunity to fish, and as such we model it as a "constant
effort" fishery. Do to having less efficient boats, Fleet One has a
higher cost per distance coefficient than Fleet Two. Fleet One's home
port is located on the site of the grouper spawning aggregation.

Fleet Two is a more commercial fleet that primarily targets the
deep-water snapper population. This fleet primarily sells their catch to
local restaurants and distributors where plate-sized fish are prized,
and so for both snapper and grouper Fleet Two has a dome-shaped
selectivity pattern [@kindsvater2017]. While plate-sized deep snapper
are the primary target of Fleet Two, we model Fleet Two's selectivity
for deep snapper as logistic due to high levels of discard mortality for
deep-water snapper resulting from barotrauma. Fleet Two catches
groupers, though less than Fleet One, and receives no price for sharks
due to the requirements of a certification program through which they
sell their deep-water snapper. Accidental captures (bycatch) of sharks
do occur, which results in mortality. Fleet Two operates under
open-access dynamics, as fishing is not the only means of subsistence
for this community; short-term effort expands and contracts in response
to profitability of the primarily grouper-driven fishery. Fleet two's
home port is located further north from Fleet One.

## Methods

1. Simulate lots of states of nature with the `marlin` model

2. Fit a simpler two-patch biomass dynamics model to each simulated `marlin` model

3. Apply a series of MPA networks to both the "complex" and "simple" models

4. Compare outcomes for conservation and food security

5. Assess drivers of degree and direction of tradeoffs

## The Science to Support Spatial Management

- ABM outcomes may be highly variable for food security *and* conservation

- Sensitivity to assumptions and lack of consistent empirics contributes to mixed and/or contradictory guidance

- Research (and data!) needed to find parsimonious models of spatio-temporal marine social-ecological processes

- Best practices in interpretation of empirical evidence as well

- Uncertainty $\neq$ inaction, but we should be transparent about the risks of "management by models"

::: {.notes}
  - Potential for contradictory management advice 
  - Ability to represent **biomass** dynamics $\neq$ **spatial** dynamics

# Extras


## Things Are Complicated in Space

Population dynamics in aggregate are already complex. 

Now consider...

- Heterogeneous habitat across species
- Variable movement across different life stages, locations, and time
- Timing and location life history processes like spawning and density dependence
- Where, when, and why to fish what

## Sprinkle in Some Objectives...

Even if we know spatial population processes, we have to pair it to management

"How should I design an MPA to..."

::: {.incremental}
  - Protect a known sensitive habitat from bottom trawling
  - Protect enough of the range of a species to rebuild its population
  - Protect enough to rebuild the species while minimizing costs to the fishing sector

:::

## Simulating Outcomes of Spatial Management

Given three species and one fleet, randomly draw...

  - fishing mortality
  
  - movement rates and density dependence timing 
  
  - lots of other economic and environmental attributes

Then apply no-take MPAs...

  - Of different sizes

  - With different design strategies

  - Compare outcomes with and without MPAs
  
## The Simpler Version

- Two-patch Pella-Tomlinson model

- Density-dependent dispersal and local or global density dependence

- Fleet attrition or redistribution

- Parameters fit to data generated from a paired `marlin` simulation

- Apply same range of MPA size scenarios
