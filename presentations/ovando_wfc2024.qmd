## Where and How Much Should We Protect?

- Growing focus on spatial management ([BBNJ,30x30](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf))

- The key questions now are **"how much?"**, **"where?"**, and **"for what?"**

- We often depend on **simulations** to answer these questions

- Today's research will explore how "good" is "good enough"

## Where do MPAs Produce Win-Win Outcomes?
![[Ovando *et al.* 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06493-8) reply to Sala *et al.* 2020](imgs/fig_2.png)


## Today's Tasks

1. What are the range of tradeoffs predicted by MPA models?

2. Are simpler models reasonable emulators of more complex models?


3.  What social-ecological traits drive variation in MPA outcomes?


## The [`marlin`](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/) Model

![[https://danovando.github.io/marlin/](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/)](imgs/marlin.png)

## Methods

1. Simulate lots of states of nature with the `marlin` model

2. Fit a simpler two-patch biomass dynamics model to each simulated `marlin` model

3. Apply a series of MPA networks to both the "complex" and "simple" models

4. Compare outcomes for conservation and food security

5. Assess drivers of degree and direction of tradeoffs

## What About Climate?

## Compare the Red to the Blue Lines

![](imgs/fig_5.pdf)

## The Science to Support Spatial Management

- MPA outcomes can be highly variable

- Variation may be driven by processes that simpler models aren't able to reliably represent. 

- Research (and data!) needed to find parsimonious models of spatio-temporal marine social-ecological processes

- Uncertainty $\neq$ inaction, but we should be transparent about the risks of "management by models"

::: {.notes}
  - Potential for contradictory management advice 
  - Ability to represent **biomass** dynamics $\neq$ **spatial** dynamics

# Extras



## Equity Concerns

![Ovando *et al.* 2023](imgs/fig_4.pdf)

## Things Are Complicated in Space

Population dynamics in aggregate are already complex. 

Now consider...

- Heterogeneous habitat across species
- Variable movement across different life stages, locations, and time
- Timing and location life history processes like spawning and density dependence
- Where, when, and why to fish what

## Sprinkle in Some Objectives...

Even if we know spatial population processes, we have to pair it to management

"How should I design an MPA to..."

::: {.incremental}
  - Protect a known sensitive habitat from bottom trawling
  - Protect enough of the range of a species to rebuild its population
  - Protect enough to rebuild the species while minimizing costs to the fishing sector

:::

## Example Species Distribution

## How Real is Real Enough?

## The [`marlin`](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/) Model

Simultaneously simulate... 

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Fish

- *N* age-structured populations

- Larval & adult dispersal governed by habitat gradients ([CTMC](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/faf.12592))

- Lots of  life history bells & whistles

- Covariance matrices in species abundance

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
### Fleets

- *N* fleets targeting one or more species

- Species-specific selectivity, price, etc.

- Allocate in space and time based on range of possible economic and regulatory factors

:::


:::


## Simulating Outcomes of Spatial Management

Given three species and one fleet, randomly draw...

  - fishing mortality
  
  - movement rates and density dependence timing 
  
  - lots of other economic and environmental attributes

Then apply no-take MPAs...

  - Of different sizes

  - With different design strategies

  - Compare outcomes with and without MPAs
  
## The Simpler Version

- Two-patch Pella-Tomlinson model

- Density-dependent dispersal and local or global density dependence

- Fleet attrition or redistribution

- Parameters fit to data generated from a paired `marlin` simulation

- Apply same range of MPA size scenarios
