## Trade-offs of Spatial Management? {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"} 
- Growing focus on spatial management ([BBNJ,30x30](https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/e6d3/cd1d/daf663719a03902a9b116c34/cop-15-l-25-en.pdf))

- **Trade-offs** are critical area of research
  
  - More protection $\approx$ more conservation
  
  - At what cost?

- Science of MPA outcomes largely based on **simulations** ^[see me after with beers for discussion]

- Quality of advice depends then on **simulations** being reasonably realistic

## Model Structure Matters

Ovando *et al.* 2023 reply to Sala *et al* 2020

# 1) How variable are MPA outcomes? <br> 2)  What social-ecological traits drive results?

::: notes
key here is need to have a better sense of what you need to take into account?

### Fish

- *N* age-structured populations

- Larval & adult dispersal governed by habitat gradients ([CTMC](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/faf.12592))

- Lots of  life history bells & whistles

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
### Fleets

- *N* fleets targeting one or more of simulated species

- Species-specific selectivity, price, etc.

- Allocate in space and time based on range of possible economic and regulatory factors

## Simulating Outcomes of Spatial Management

Given three species and one fleet, randomly draw...

  - fishing mortality
  
  - adult and larval movement rates and density dependence timing 
  
  - lots of other economic and environmental attributes

Then apply no-take MPAs...

  - Of different sizes

  - With different design strategies


## MPA Outcomes are Highly Variable

## We Need To Put Models To The Test

- Policies have complex effects in social-ecological systems, particularly the less direct they are

- Overly simple models can produce unreliable projections of conservation and food security outcomes

- Models that reasonably capture complexity and dynamism of open oceans needed to make objectives like BBNJ effective

- Next generation of MPA science needs to confront models with data 

::: notes
  
"Quadrant" predictions easier than absolute outcomes?

-   Be on the lookout for `marlin` paper sometime in the next year (fingers
    crossed)
