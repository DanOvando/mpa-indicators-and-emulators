## MPA Emulators

Title: Predicted Effects of Marine Protected Areas on Conservation and Catches are Highly Sensitive to Model Structure

Manuscript File: [02_emulators_paper.qmd]()

Abstract: Use of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is expanding around the world. While MPAs can have a wide variety of objectives, scientific guidance on how to design MPAs to achieve objectives is generally based on simulation modeling. While some types of model are not able to answer some types of question, in other cases many different models may all provide an answer of some kind, such as the predicted change in population biomass and fisheries catches resulting from implementation of an MPA. In these cases, the spatial and temporal scale of MPAs often prevents us from determining which model is most parsimoneous empirically, and as such the choice of model can be somewhat *ad hoc*. In this paper we compare the effects of MPAs on catch and biomass predicted by a spatially explicit age-structured multi-species and multi-fleet (*High-definition*) model to the predictions generated by a two-patch surplus production (*Low-definition*) model fit to emulate the *High-definition* model. We found that while there are some areas of agreement, in many cases the predictions of the two models were markedly different, with the Low-definition model frequently predicting substantially higher biomass and catch benefits from MPAs than the High-definition model, and in many cases incorrectly estimating the direction (positive or negative) of the MPA effects. Our results show that care should be taken in selecting and interpreting the results of MPA simultion models, and that research is needed to understand what models are best suited to what policy recommendations when multiple viable options exist.
